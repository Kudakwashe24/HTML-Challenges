            There are a few characteristics that are shared by most species. For example there are New World Monkeys and Old World monkeys. New World monkeys have tails that can grasp and hold things, and Old World monkeys don’t have this. That’s pretty cool having such a strong and handy tail! It’s quite easy to see the difference between Old World and New World monkeys just by their faces, which look rather different from each other. The only things that are similar are their noses, cheeks and forward facing eyes. Old World monkeys are found in Africa and New World monkeys are found in South America. Apes are sometimes mistaken for monkeys but they actually aren’t monkeys.</p>
